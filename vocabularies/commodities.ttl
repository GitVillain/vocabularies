    skos:definition "A dense, hard siliceous-rock with low porosity. Cherts are tough, compact rocks with low porosity that are composed mainly of microcrystalline quartz and varying amounts of impurities (Folk et al 1952; Smith 1960). The quartz occurs as randomly interlocked, microscopic quartz grains (microquartz) or fibrous chalcedony (Folk et al 1952; Smith 1960; Oldershaw 1968; Knauth 1994). Cherts occur in a variety of geological settings, for example: - Bedded cherts may form by compaction and recrystallization of silica-rich biogenic sediments made of opaline tests of single-cell organisms (diatoms, radiolaria) or remains of silicious sponges, both in marine and in lake environments. During diagenesis, the silica in the sediments undergoes a transformation from opal-A through opal-CT to microcrystalline quartz in the mature chert (Oldershaw 1968; Calvert 1971; Lancelot 1973; Hein et al 1981; Pisciotto 1981; Riech 1981; Levitan 1983; Jones et al 1986; Compton 1991). Accordingly, these cherts may contain some opal-CT. Silica mobilized from volcaniclastic sediments, hydrothermal solutions and clay minerals may contribute to the silicification (Calvert 1971; Thurston 1972; Pollock 1987; Hesse 1989). - Cherts in banded iron formations are thought to have formed from primarily chemically precipitated silica. Often they are colored brightly by co-precipitated iron minerals (Sugitani et al 1998; Rosiare et al 2000; Maliva et al 2005; Fisher et al 2008). - Many cherts appear to have been formed by silicification of volcaniclastic sediments and other rock types (Knauth 1994). - Nodules, irregular bodies and discontinuous layers of chert are found in marine calcareous sediments. They typically form during early diagenesis by precipitation of silica mobilized from biogenic sources like radiolarian tests or sponge spicules. (Buurman et al 1971; Meyers 1977; Bustillo et al 1987; Maliva et al 1989; Knauth 1994; Madsen et al 2010). - Magadi-type cherts, named after their occurrence at Lake Magadi, Kenya, form by leaching of alkali ions from silicates in silica-rich evaporites (Hay 1968; Eugster 1969). The term 'chert' is occasionally also used for massive rocks made primarily of microcrystalline quartz that deposits around submarine volcanic hydrothermal vents ('black smokers'; Hopkinson et al 1999; Gutzmer et al 2001), or that formed as siliceous sinter, like Rhynie chert (Hesse 1989). Siliceous precursor rocks of comparable texture that are primarily made of opal-A or opal-CT are sometimes also called chert, but usually with the addition of the dominant silica phase, for example, 'opaline chert' (e.g. Weaver et al 1972; Pisciotto 1981, Calvert 1983; Cady et al 1996)."@en ;

Rarely also blue, lavender-mauve, black, red or yellow in colour, depending on mineralogy and impurity elements. In 1863, French mineralogist Alexis Damour discovered that what at the time was being called jade, were in fact 2 distinct mineral species, namely jadeite and nephrite. Many different rocks and minerals have been marketed as jade, especially nephrite and serpentine, but also green quartz, vesuvianite (californite), etc. Gemmologists, however, usually restrict the name to just jadeite and nephrite, both characteristically forming very tough, fine grained rocks. Nephrite is much more common than jadeite, and is a tremolite and/or actinolite-rich rock, and this is why it has been classified here as a type of metamorphic rock rather than a generic term. Jade from Myanmar has been divided into five groups according to the main mineral constituent of the respective sample (Franz et al., 2014): (1) jadeitites with kosmochlor and clinoamphibole, (2) jadeitites with clinoamphibole, (3) albite-bearing jadeitites, (4) almost pure jadeitites and (5) omphacitites.Visit gemdat.org for gemological information about Jade."@en ;

    skos:definition "An unlithified heterogeneous mixture of a wide range of plant debris. It has a carbon content of less than 60% dry ash free and a volatile content of greater than 63%. There are two types of peat, low moor (Flachmoor) and high moor (Hochmoor) peat. Low moor peat is the most common starting material in coal genesis. It therefore constitutes a caustobiolith of low diagenetic degree. Peat is formed in marshes and swamps from the dead, and partly decomposed remains of the marsh vegetation. Stagnant ground water is necessary for peat formation to protect the residual plant material from decay. Peat has a yellowish brown to brownish black color, is generally of the fibrous consistency, and can be either plastic or friable; in its natural state it can be cut; further, it has a very high moisture content (above 75%, generally above 90%). It can be distinguished from brown coal by the fact that the greater part of its moisture content can be squeezed out by pressure (e.g., in the hand). Peat also contains more plant material in a reasonably good state of preservation than brown coal. Individual plant elements, such as roots, stems, leaves, and seeds, can commonly be seen in it with the unaided eye. Failing that, treatment of peat with dilute alkali will make visible many of these plant tissues. Further, peat is richer in cellulose than brown coal (reaction with Fehling's solution). Unlike brown coal, peat still contains cellulose, protected by lignin or cutin, which gives a reaction with chlorzinc iodide. Correspondingly, peat shows under the microscope tissues that have not undergone either lignification, suberinization, or cutinization; this is not the case in brown coal. The reflectance of peat is low (about 0.3%). Microscopic examination is best undertaken with transmitted light. Ref: Hower, James. (2002).

    skos:definition "A sand-grade clastic-sediment. Note: the majority of sand can be classed as silicate-sand. i. A rock fragment or detrital particle smaller than a granule and larger than a coarse silt grain, having a diameter in range of 1/16 to 2 mm (62 to 2,000 mu m, or 0.0025 to 0.08 in, or 4 to 1 phi units, or a size between that at the lower limit of visibility of an individual particle with the unaided eye and that of the head of a small wooden match), being somewhat rounded by abrasion in the course of transport. In Great Britain, the range of 0.1 to 1 mm has been used. See Also: coarse sand, fine sand Ref: AGI ii. A loose aggregate, unlithified mineral or rock particles of sand size; an unconsolidated or moderately consolidated sedimentary deposit consisting essentially of medium-grained clastics. The material is most commonly composed of quartz, and when the term sand is used without qualification, a siliceous composition is implied; but the particles may be of any mineral composition or mixture of rock or mineral fragments, such as coral sand consisting of limestone fragments. Also, a mass of such material, esp. on a beach, desert, or in a streambed. Ref: AGI iii. Separate grains or particles of detrital rock material, easily distinguishable by the unaided eye, but not large enough to be called pebbles; also, a loose mass of such grains, forming an incoherent arenaceous sediment. Building sand, any hard, granular rock material finer than gravel and coarser than dust. The term indicates material comminuted by natural means. Ref: Fay iv. Detrital material of size range from 2 to 1/16 mm in diameter. Very coarse, 1 to 2 mm; coarse, 1/2 to 1 mm; medium, 1/4 to 1/2 mm; fine, 1/4 to 1/8 mm; very fine, 1/8 to 1/16 mm. Ref: AGI v. Granular material, composed mainly of quartz, that will settle readily in water. In the mechanical analysis of soil, sand--according to international classification--has a size between 0.02 mm and 2.0 mm. It has no cohesion when dry or saturated but has apparent cohesion when damp. Ref: Nelson vi. A term used in the United States for a rock or mineral particle in the soil, having a diameter in the range of 0.05 to 2 mm; prior to 1947, the range 1 to 2 mm was called fine gravel. The diameter range recognized by the International Society of Soil Science is 0.02 to 2 mm. A textural class of soil material containing 85% or more of sand, with the percentage of silt plus 1.5 times the percentage of clay not exceeding 15; specif. such material containing 25% or more of very coarse sand, coarse sand, and medium sand, and less than 50% of fine sand or very fine sand. The term has also been used for a soil containing 90% or more of sand. Ref: AGI"@en ;

Clays are soft and plastic when wet due to the platy particle shape and fine size and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying. Clays are white or pale coloured when pure but appear in various colours from grey to black, green, yellow, brown or red when impure. Clays are usually distinguished by geologists or pedologists from other fine-grained soils and sediments by their grain size and/or mineralogy, though geotechnical engineers distinguish them by plasticity. Silts, which are fine-grained soils and sediments that are not normally dominated by clay minerals, have larger particle sizes than clays. Geologists usually consider the division to occur at a particle size of 2 µm, sedimentologists often use 45 Î¼m, and colloid chemists use 1 Î¼m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 Î¼m and silt particles as being larger."@en ;
