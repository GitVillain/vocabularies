However, where information is aggregated on an information asset such as an ICT server, the impact of compromise may increase and with it, the controls.  OFFICIAL information is routine information without special sensitivity or handling requirements. All routine public-sector business, operations and services is treated as OFFICIAL. At the OFFICIAL classification there is a general presumption that data may be shared across government. Security measures should be proportionate and driven by the business requirement.
